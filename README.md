NetworkModels
=============

Some simulations to generate networks

******

#Classes: 

- Network class:
Every Algorithm that generates a network should inherit from the Network class.
Every network has vertexes and every vertex has edges.
Network -> vertex -> edges
    - operator[i] -> list of vertex pointed by ith element

- Vertex class:
The vertexes has some connections with other vertexes.
Those connections are stored inside the class edges.
    - operator[i] -> ith conected vertex
    - operator(i) -> ith edge

- Edge class:
A class that holds information of which is the owner vector an with which other
vertex it has a connection.
